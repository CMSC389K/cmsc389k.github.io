                        <p><b>Welcome to CMSC389K!</b></p>
                        <p>We are Sashank and Ishaan, your TAs for this semester. We have spent a lot of time designing the coursework for this class, and we hope you will enjoy it! Let us go over a few things:</p>
                        <h3>Course Website</h3>
                        <p>This is the course website. We will be posting announcements on both Piazza and this website. The website does not have a lot of information, but does link to the <a href="syllabus.html">GitHub repo</a>, which is extremely important. This repo contains all lecture notes, projects, etc.</p>
                        <h3>Syllabus</h3>
                        <p>You can find that in the GitHub repo <a href="/syllabus.html">here</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Class Structure</h3>
                        <p>Before every class, you should read the <code><b>pre_class.md</b></code> file for that week, and do whatever it says. </p>
                        <p>This could involve reading through external links, following a tutorial, or something else. These make sure you are prepared for class that week and should not take long. During class, we will almost always be doing a coding exercise together. This exercise works with the assumption that you did the material in the <code><b>pre_class.md</b></code> file. </p>
                        <p>We will not be posting the complete in-class coding exercises until after class, and there will be little explanation in that file on how it was created (this is how we incentivize coming to class). </p>
                        <p>Some classes will conclude with a worksheet that you can take home. These will not be graded for accuracy or completion; these are solely for your understanding.</p>
                        <p>All files from class can be found in the <code><b>lectures/</b></code> folder of the GH repo</p>
                        <h3>Projects</h3>
                        <p>This class is driven by project-based learning. We will be uploading each project the day it is assigned (see syllabus). The requirements are clear in all project descriptions; we are not trying to get you with test cases. </p>
                        <p>Projects are due at 11:59 PM on the indicated Thursdays before class.</p>
                        <h3>Office Hours and Help</h3>
                        <p>While we have not figured out exactly what time we want to do office hours, feel free to email us (emails provided in syllabus) if you have any questions. We want to help you succeed, so please do not be afraid to reach out! </p>
                        <p>As soon as we know when we are holding office hours, info will be posted under <a href="contact.html">contact</a> on this site. </p>
                        <p>We look forward to meeting all of you in person! Have a great rest of break.</p>
